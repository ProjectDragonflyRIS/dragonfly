            <!-- question 1 -->
            <div class="question">
                <b>1) How is this particularly different from other existing products like this?</b>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                As previously mentioned, this is a product that not only 
                will factually change how we use vehicles and how they operate, but is more 
                adaptive both towards the environment and society's economy.
            </div>
            <!-- question 2 -->
            <div class="question">
                <b>2) How will you receive funding for this project?</b>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                Well, there are several ways with which we will be able to get this project funded, 
                the simplest of which being: sell it to investors and let them take it from there. 
                Another option would be to partner with existing companies that may benefit from this, 
                and use their funding in order to create the first functional dragonfly machine.
            </div>
            <!-- question 3 -->
            <div class="question">
                <b>3) What are the long term results to switching to this type of vehicle for major shipping businesses?</b>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                We bring together modern technology into every day lives via environmentally healthy resources and the ability 
                to save as much materials as possible, since you will no longer need seperate 
                vehicles for different forms of travel, exploration, and shipping. <br><br>
                It may be hard to believe, but if we all collectively began using this vehicle in 
                place of planes, helicopters, trucks, and ships,
                which mind you all are conventionally powered by oils, we would have a plethora of 
                freed metals and resource. These may be recycled
                and reused for other purposes, which will allow economies and industries grow, as 
                critical demands for certain things will drop.
            </div>
            <!-- question 4 -->
            <div class="question">
                <b>4) What is the Dragonfly Modular Customization System&copy?</b>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                Our drone can be customized to the clients will, they may choose the size and 
                which uses the drone/vehicle may have. For example, some drones may be used for 
                rescues or others may be used only for cargo. <br><br>
                The ability to change the functionality and size of the 
                vehicle moves us a crucial step into transportation and delivery capabilities.
            </div>
